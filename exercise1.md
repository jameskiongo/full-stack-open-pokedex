In a typical CI pipeline, linting, testing, and building are crucial steps. For a JavaScript/TypeScript project, common tools include:

    Linting: ESLint (with plugins like @typescript-eslint for TypeScript) ensures code style consistency.

    Testing: Jest or Mocha (with Chai for assertions) are popular for unit/integration tests.

    Building: Tools like Webpack, Vite, or tsc (TypeScript compiler) bundle the application.

Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, alternatives include:

    GitLab CI/CD: Integrated into GitLab, with strong Docker support.

    CircleCI: Cloud-based, with easy YAML configuration.

    Travis CI: A simpler cloud option for open-source projects.

    Azure Pipelines: Microsoft’s solution, flexible for hybrid environments.

Choosing between self-hosted (e.g., Jenkins on-premise) and cloud-based (e.g., GitHub Actions) depends on:

    Cost: Cloud CI may charge per minute (e.g., GitHub Actions), while self-hosted requires hardware upkeep.

    Security: Sensitive projects may prefer self-hosted control.

    Scalability: Cloud CI handles spikes better (e.g., parallel jobs).

To decide, you’d need:

    Budget constraints.

    Compliance requirements (e.g., data residency).

    Team size and build frequency (high traffic favors cloud).
